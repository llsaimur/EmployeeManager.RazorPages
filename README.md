# EmployeeManager.RazorPages

In this version of Employee Manager, I am using ASP.NET Core Razor Pages. The user
interface is built using Tag Helpers. The model validations are performed using data
annotations. The database CRUD operations are performed using Entity Framework
Core. The EF Core model is built using reverse engineering techniques. Mapping with
the table schema is illustrated using data annotations as well as Fluent API. The user
authentication and security is provided using ASP.NET Core Identity. 

Functionalities:
  -Signing In to Employee Manager 
  -Creating a New User Account
  -Listing All the Employees
  -Inserting a New Employee 
  -Updating Existing Employee
  -Deleting Existing Employee
  -Signing Out of Employee Manager

What I learned:
  • Use Razor Pages and Tag Helpers to build a web user interface
  • Build the EF Core model from the existing database using reverse
  engineering
  • Implement authentication using ASP.NET Core Identity
  asynchronous operations
  • Use exception handling middleware to trap unhandled errors
